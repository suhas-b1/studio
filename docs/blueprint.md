# **App Name**: Nourish Connect

## Core Features:

- Donor Food Listing: Allow donors (restaurants, hotels, supermarkets) to list available surplus food with details like quantity and type.
- NGO Food Request: Enable NGOs, shelters, and community kitchens to view available food listings and claim donations.
- Smart Matching Algorithm: Automatically match food donations with nearby, verified NGOs based on need and availability, prioritizing the listings by freshness of item.
- Real-time Notifications: Send real-time alerts to both donors and recipients when a donation is listed, claimed, and picked up.
- Verification System: Implement a verification process for both donors and recipients to ensure credibility and safety.
- Impact Tracking: Provide donors with a dashboard to track their food donations and quantify their impact on reducing food waste and helping the community.
- Listing and Suggestion Tool: AI tool for donors to suggest food listing titles from images or short descriptions of the food items, to help streamline the listing process. This AI model incorporates logic to not violate any health guidelines and it will discard non-safe listings, for example anything opened, used, expired etc. Food images can be directly fed as an image to our Image Understanding model to detect list item to donate or donors can submit listing with titles.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark orange (#FF851B) to evoke energy, warmth, and appetite.
- Background color: Very light desaturated orange (#FFF3E0), almost white, for a clean and inviting look.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to convey trust and balance.
- Body and headline font: 'Lato' for a modern and friendly feel.
- Use food anime images, with photos, in the icons related to food, community, and logistics.
- Use a clear, intuitive layout with distinct sections for donors and recipients. UI should be great.
- Attractive 3D effects and transitions to guide users through the donation and request process.
